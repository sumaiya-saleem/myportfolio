				<h4> Overview </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> 
				Experiencing discomfort when trying to access and navigate the current voicemail system, we observed that this is a pain point among the majority of voicemail users. Therefore, we identified the need for a design change from the current audio management system to a visual system that would improve efficiency for users. Following an experimental design process, my partner and I created several design iterations conducting user testing for each, and using statistical analysis to determine the validity of the hypothesis.</p>

				<h4> Sketches + Initial Ideation</h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> For the initial ideation, we considered the different flaws with the current voicemail system, and what features would need to be included/removed for a better experience. Currently, voicemails are primarily audio-based, giving limited control to the user for sorting through voicemails, catching certain details in a voicemail, and deleting voicemails. As a result, this wastes users’ time and increases preventable frustration. Our proposed voicemail interface will allow users to visually see their voicemails and have easy control through buttons and interactive UI elements such as a progress bar, delete button, pin to top, etc. The measure of success variables will be time and user satisfaction.

				<h5>Scenarios —</h5>
				<p>Each user would be given the same scenario, and would go through the current audio voicemail system, then with our prototype. The voicemail content was kept different for audio voicemail system and visual voicemail system. The scenarios for the final testing session were as follows: 
					<li>Task — play the voicemail sent by the doctor’s office, write down when your appointment, delete the voicemail after</li>
					<li>Task — Find and play the two voicemails sent by Grandma, call her back after listening to both voicemails</li>

					<li><strong>Dependent variables:</strong> To test the effectiveness, the variables measured would be completion rate, task completition time, and measure of ease according to NASA-TLX (to measure cognitive load) and 7 Single Ease Questions (SEQ). </li>
					<li><strong>Confound Variables</strong>: To avoid the learning effect, we did not have the same content of voicemails for each interface, but have the same type/importance. This ensures that we are tesing the our UI and not user knowledge, therefore keeping both the content of the message, and who the sender is different.</li>

				<h4> Statistical Tests & Analysis</h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> When observing our users throughout user testing sessions, we used statistical tests that included Analysis of Variance (to support parametric observations in the NASA-TLX), Friedman Test (to support non-parametric observations in SEQ). Using PAST statistical testing software, all datasets were first tested for nomrmality. If normally distributed, the ANOVA test was run when appropriate, otherwise conducting the Friedman test or the Wilcoxon test. The statistical analysis is summarized below, in consideration to the hypotheses below: 
					<div class="blue-background">
				Hypotheses:
				<li>H0: There is no difference between audio and visual system in terms of satisfaction including ease of use</li>

					<h5><span class="blue-highlight">Measuring Duration</span>  - Analysis of Variance using ANOVA</h5>
				<p>This test was to measure  whether there is a statistical difference between the audio voicemail system and the visual voicemail system in terms of task completion time. Based off the results, we can conclude there is a statistical difference between using the visual system over the audio system; we can reject the null hypothesis. There is statistical evidence to show a visual system provides a faster method, compared to the audio system, for checking and accessing voicemails on iPhones.

				<p>The Friedman test was conducted for the satisfaction metric data in terms of ease of use ranging from 1 - 7, where 1 = very difficult and 7 = very easy. Therefore, the question to answer using the Friedman test is if there is any statistical significance between audio and visual voicemail systems. The test concluded that there is a statistical significance between audio and visual system, where the visual system is preferred over the audio system.</p>

				<h4> Conclusion</h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> This project commenced with identifying pain-points of iPhone users in regards to accessing voicemail. Currently, iPhones have an audio voicemail system with limited visual functions for the user to utilize. Through initial user interviews, we found users would like to have more control over their voicemail to reduce time and effort spent navigating their voicemails. Furthermore, through A/B testing and statistical analysis of an audio system and our prototype of a visual system, we can conclude there is a statistical significance to support our alternative hypothesis that the graphical playback controls of voicemails is more effective than the audio-only management of voicemail. Specifically, we found a visual system results in lower task time (i.e. it is faster), higher user interface satisfaction rates, and higher ease of use. Overall, the visual system aims to resolve the initial pain-points and frustrations of users and provide a better user experience.

			<p class="col-md-12"> <strong class="project-heading">About the Project</strong> <br> 
				Two main goals of the project was to first redesign the Prepr website, and simplify content structure while adding more informational and campaign pages, keeping consistent layout and brand identity. The second goal was to add additional feature to the Prepr mobile app, and following  the existing UI standards that are in place, while communicating with the outsourced development team. 
			</p>
				<br>
			
				<p class="col-md-12"> <strong class="project-heading">Ideation</strong> <br> 
				Prepr had an existing website and application in development when I joined, but was in need of design updates and addition of pages/features. When applying for the role, the company issued a <a href="files/preprchallenge.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>design challenge</strong></a> which was used as a starting point to the websites redesign. Along with the design and marketing team, we created sketches and outlined a new sitemap for the website.
			</p>
				
			
			<p class="col-md-6"> <strong class="project-heading">Style Guide</strong> <br> Working alongside another designer, and leading two UX designer volunteers, we implemented a style guide that would allow for consistent branding throughout the Prepr Network pages. Collaborating with other designers with this guide established the visual elements on each page. In addition, I designed numerous icons that would continue to solidify this branding.

			<p class="col-md-12 mt-3"> <strong class="project-heading">High-Fidelity Mockups</strong> <br> Using Figma, we created numerous high-fidelity mockups, organizing them based on their site map hierarchy. After getting approval for each page, I asissted the developer in transorming some of these pages on Wordpress. To keep track of pages were completed, need to be revised, or were ready for development, we created an excel file to audit all the content.    </p>

			<p class="col-md-12 mt-2"> <strong class="project-heading">Mobile Design</strong> <br> Using Figma, I created various screens and user flows for the mobile app. I had to work with the existing UI of the app, and had to describe the functionality of each step in the flow as this would be communicated to with an outsourced development team. The image below shows a sample of the mobile app tutorial created. </p>
