				<h4> Overview </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> 
				Experiencing discomfort when trying to access and navigate the current voicemail system, we observed that this is a pain point among the majority of voicemail users. Therefore, we identified the need for a design change from the current audio management system to a visual system that would improve efficiency for users. </p>

			<p class="col-md-12"> <strong class="project-heading">About the Project</strong> <br> 
				Two main goals of the project was to first redesign the Prepr website, and simplify content structure while adding more informational and campaign pages, keeping consistent layout and brand identity. The second goal was to add additional feature to the Prepr mobile app, and following  the existing UI standards that are in place, while communicating with the outsourced development team. 
			</p>
				<br>
			
				<p class="col-md-12"> <strong class="project-heading">Ideation</strong> <br> 
				Prepr had an existing website and application in development when I joined, but was in need of design updates and addition of pages/features. When applying for the role, the company issued a <a href="files/preprchallenge.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>design challenge</strong></a> which was used as a starting point to the websites redesign. Along with the design and marketing team, we created sketches and outlined a new sitemap for the website.
			</p>
				
			
			<p class="col-md-6"> <strong class="project-heading">Style Guide</strong> <br> Working alongside another designer, and leading two UX designer volunteers, we implemented a style guide that would allow for consistent branding throughout the Prepr Network pages. Collaborating with other designers with this guide established the visual elements on each page. In addition, I designed numerous icons that would continue to solidify this branding.
