				<h4> Overview </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> 
				
					I worked on Bread Pledge as part of a self-directed research project, alongside the supervision of a professor. Bread Pledge is an app that aims to connect businesses who have food to be rescued, to organizations serving communities in need. The UX case study aims to solve the problem of increased food waste in Toronto, outlining the research and design process of the proposed solution as a mobile app.

				<h4> Key Research Findings</h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> 
					
					When developing the project proposal, I conducted secondary research to gain a better understanding of the issue of food waste existing in Toronto, why current solution attempts have not lead to any significant improvements, and what challenge exist behind developing a cohesive solution. Key findings that identify the need for a solution include:
					
					<li>More than half of all food produced in Canada is wasted, and roughly one third of that food can be rescued and sent to communities in need</li>
					<li> Food waste in Toronto becomes a costly resource that contributes to economic and environmental concerns</li>
					<li> Wasted food tends to derive largely from production facilities, restaurants, and institutions, while existing initiatives only focus on individual food waste</li>

				<h4> Challenge</h4>

					How can we connect and motivate production facilities, restaurants, and other institutions who have food that can be rescued, to organizations dealing with communities in need?

				<h4> Solution </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> 
				The solution I will explore is an app that is a platform that connects both parties involved- donating organizations and organizatins in need of rescued food- to be able to seamlessly connect and communicate, while also maintaining legal considerations that exist with food donation in Ontario, as well as educating parties on benefits to provide incentive.

				<h4> Defining the User </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> Three distinct personas have been identified based off the research conducted. The target audiences can be identified as  professionals (aged 20-60) aiming to either donate food for their company (business donor) or organize the charitable donation of the food (non-profit organization), for environmental or ethical purposes, and supporting/improving company values.

				<h4> Product Ideation </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> Once the user was understood, I began with ideation of the user flow, brand design, as well as wireframe sketches in order to define the direction of the app before diving into the actual design. Based off the preliminary research findings and the user personas, the objectives the app should aim to meet include:
					<li>A way for businesses with excess food that can be rescued to easily connect with non-profit communities and share food items the moment they become available while staying educated on legality </li>
					<li> A way for non-profit organizations to easily view available product listings and accept the items that works for their organization </li>
					<li> A way for business donors and non-profit organizations to connect to share resources in the long term</li>

				<h4> Lo-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
				<p class="mt-4">
					Working from sketches created after the information architecture was finalized, I used Figma to transform that vision into lo-fidelity wireframes for the main pages including login screens, dashboards, donation board, community page, and FAQ for both business donor's as well as non-profit organizations.

				<h4> High Fidelity Mockups </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> Once satisfied with the wireframes, I moved on to converting them to hi-fidelity app mockeups. The following screens display some of the bread pledge's key features that align meeting the original goals and objectives. 
				</p>
			</div>
	  </div>

				
		<div class="col-md-12 mt-3">
			<h5> Business Donor Dashboard -</h5>
			<div class="row bp-wireframes">
				<div class="col-md-4"><img src="images/hi-donor1.png" alt="lo-fidelity login screens" class="img-wireframes"></div>
				<p class="col-md-8 mt-5"> This first dashboard is for the business donor's interface. A key feature is that it allows the donor to view the status of their donation posting, with the options being under review (being reviewed by bread pledge team), awaiting match (the posting was approved, but now waiting for a non-profit organization to accept), successful donation, and rejected leading to the FAQ page for why their posting may have been rejected. <br> The dashboard would also contain a notification screen with status notifications as well as community connection requests. Finally, the general posting board will also be displayed to encourage further submissions from donors.     </p>

			</div>

			</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-12 mt-5">
			<h5> Business Donor Donate -</h5>
			<div class="row bp-wireframes">
				<div class="col-md-4"><img src="images/hi-donor2.png" alt="lo-fidelity login screens" class="img-wireframes"></div>
				<p class="col-md-8 mt-5">The donation screen is the most crucial portion to the business donor side, as this is what allows the user to share their posting. This screen displays a form where users can simply add a posting. The name of organization would be auto filled, and then they can put the item they are donating, the amount of that item, expiry date, and any additional information (possibly the reason for it going unconsumed). They can post on the public donor board which would be available for all users to see, or just share with an organization they have connected to and it would appear for them specifically. The contents on the form would reflect on the public donor board available on the dashboard, as well as the donor board for non-profit organizations who would be able to view the date and time of the posting as well. Once submitted, it is reflected on the dashboard status section.</p>

			</div>

			</div>

			<div class="col-md-12 mt-5">
			<h5> Non-profit Organization Dashboard -</h5>
			<div class="row bp-wireframes">
				<div class="col-md-4"><img src="images/hi-np1.png" alt="lo-fidelity login screens" class="img-wireframes"></div>
				<p class="col-md-8 mt-5"> This dashboard is created for the non-profit organization interface. Similar to the Business Donor view, the dashboard would consist of status updates on donations they wish to receive, and a notifications bar. The status updates would be successful delivery (they have recieved the donation), pending approval (approval of request), delivery (the donation is on its way), and denied, which would lead to the FAQ page for why it was denied. <br> The screen also contains a notification section to see new community requests or other updates. </p>

			</div>

			</div>
				
			<div class="col-md-12 mt-5">
			<h5> Non-profit Organization Donor Board -</h5>
			<div class="row bp-wireframes">
				<div class="col-md-4"><img src="images/hi-np2.png" alt="lo-fidelity login screens" class="img-wireframes"></div>
				<p class="col-md-8 mt-5"> Once the business donor creates a posting, it immediately reflects onto this screen. The donor board for non-profit is more detailed than business, as they actual have means of interaction with it. It shows the postings that the businesse donor made with the date and time, as well as any additional details on the posting. Once requesting a donation, the dashboard status is updated for both parties.</p>

			</div>

			</div>
				
			<div class="col-md-12 mt-5">
			<h5> Connecting to the Community -</h5>
			<div class="row bp-wireframes">
				<div class="col-md-2"><img src="images/hi-donor3.png" alt="lo-fidelity login screens" class="img-wireframes mr-5"></div>
				<div class="col-md-2"><img src="images/hi-np3.png" alt="lo-fidelity login screens" class="img-wireframes mr-5"></div>
				<p class="col-md-8 ml-5 mt-5"> The community screen exists for both the business donor and non-profit interfaces. For businesses, the community screen would allow donors to directly connect with participating non-profit organizations, so they can communicate and commit to donations for easier and more consistent postings. For non-profit's, it would display a list of business donors and participating organizations, and the user may request to connect if they desire seeing more of their postings more consistently.</p>

				<h4> Branding and Style Guide </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> To effectively create hi-fidelity mockups from the wireframes, I first created a style guide that best fits the bread pledge mission, and implementing the mood, colour scheme, and iconography that would give bread pledge a fresh yet professional look. The images below include the style guide as well as screenshot of the Figma file.

				<h4> Reflection + Next Steps </h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> This was my first passion project and personal UX case study. Wanting to use all the skills I have learned in my courses, I wanted to go through the entire design process and was able to create my first functional prototype. While I had thorough background research on the topic, I believe the project would be enhanced with UX research through user interviews with the parties involved, and user testing with different design iterations. The project is one that is immensely detailed, and realize that there are alot more screens to be made to display a few of the details that were mentioned but not included in the final design. Working alongside my professor I learned alot about the UX process and journey, and hope to apply these skills in upcoming projects.
