			<p class="ml-3">Prepr is a leading startup for open education platforms, and provides students, educators, and organizations to collaborate and solve real world challenges. In the four month internship, I was responsible for creating new solutions for improving visual design of the Prepr website and app, using Figma, Adobe Illustrator/InDesign, and InVision to wireframe, design, and prototype over 100 website and app screens. </p> <br>
			
			<p class="col-md-12"> <strong class="project-heading">About the Project</strong> <br> 
				Two main goals of the project was to first redesign the Prepr website, and simplify content structure while adding more informational and campaign pages, keeping consistent layout and brand identity. The second goal was to add additional feature to the Prepr mobile app, and following  the existing UI standards that are in place, while communicating with the outsourced development team. 
			</p>
				<br>
			
				<p class="col-md-12"> <strong class="project-heading">Ideation</strong> <br> 
				Prepr had an existing website and application in development when I joined, but was in need of design updates and addition of pages/features. When applying for the role, the company issued a <a href="file:///Macintosh HD/Users/user/Desktop/PORTFOLIO SITE UPDATE/files/preprchallenge.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>design challenge</strong></a> which was used as a starting point to the websites redesign. Along with the design and marketing team, we created sketches and outlined a new sitemap for the website.
			</p>
				
			
			<p class="col-md-6"> <strong class="project-heading">Style Guide</strong> <br> Working alongside another designer, and leading two UX designer volunteers, we implemented a style guide that would allow for consistent branding throughout the Prepr Network pages. Collaborating with other designers with this guide established the visual elements on each page. In addition, I designed numerous icons that would continue to solidify this branding.

			<p class="col-md-12 mt-3"> <strong class="project-heading">High-Fidelity Mockups</strong> <br> Using Figma, we created numerous high-fidelity mockups, organizing them based on their site map hierarchy. After getting approval for each page, I assissted the developer in transorming some of these pages on Wordpress. To keep track of pages were completed, need to be revised, or were ready for development, we created an excel file to audit all the content.    </p>

		  <script>
				$("#zoom").elevateZoom({
				zoomType: "inner",
				cursor: "zoom-in",

			   }); 
			  
			</script>
		
			<p class="col-md-12 mt-2"> <strong class="project-heading">Mobile Design</strong> <br> Using Figma, I created various screens and user flows for the mobile app. I had to work with the existing UI of the app, and had to describe the functionality of each step in the flow as this would be communicated to with an outsourced development team. The image below shows a sample of the mobile app tutorial created. </p>

			<p class="col-md-12 mb-5 mt-2"> <strong class="project-heading">Additional Projects</strong> <br> Throughout my time at Prepr, I worked on additional projects that were outside the internship scope. These projects included challenge box designs, acitivities books, brochures, pitch presentations, Apple Watch visioning, and more. </p>
